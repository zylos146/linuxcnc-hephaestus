On / Off control:
- Compressor (Actually needs to be on whenever spindle is on. Shouldn't allow spindle to turn on unless air pressure is present)
- Lighting
- Vacuum
- Coolant Pump
- Coolant Valve (CNC or Dump)

Liquid:
- Bucket -> Filter -> Pump -> Valve
- Valve (A) -> CNC
- Valve (B) -> Dump (for exchanging coolant fluid)

Inputs:
- Door Sensor L (NC = closed door)
- Door Sensor R (NC = closed door)
- Spindle Start (NO)
- Spindle Stop (Momentary E-Stop - NC)
- Steppers Powered (Feeds into Machine Power state?)
- Spindle Powered (NO output from Safety Relay)
- Pressure Sensor (4-20mA?) for Air Line to Spindle

Sensors:
- X Home Switch (NC - Pull Up)
- Y Home Switch (NC - Pull Up)
- Z Home Switch (NC - Pull Up)
- Probe Switch (NC - Pull Up)
- Touch-off Switch
- 

Contactors:
- 
- 

Control Panel (4x Yellow):
-- Compressor has to be controlled by Linuxcnc, as it's required for Spindle operation
- Vacuum On/Off
- Compressor On/Off (Can be overrided by Linuxcnc to start Spindle, or maybe just pressure sensor needs to be monitored?)
- Light On/Off
- Spindle Start/Reset


E-Stop:
- Shutoff Coolant
-- Could be leaking, spraying in unwanted places, etc
- Shutoff Spindle
-- Could be crashed, etc
- Shutoff Steppers
-- Do so by interrupting 48V Stepper Power
-- Do -not- shut-off the Beckhoff stack

- E-Stop can be fed from
-- Pendant Button
-- Beckhoff Output (High is Active - SM Watchdog will de-activate if system goes down)
-- Mushroom Button

- E-Stop status will feed into 
-- Main Contactor
-- Beckhoff Input

-- TODO - Add pressure switch to prevent spindle from running unless air curtain is active
-- TODO - Switch coolant bucket to hopper style to allow full draining for cleaning? (I think I just need to add some extra water to flush it out)
--      - Could also better mount the suction inlet so it's properly mounted at the bottom of the bucket


-- I want to be able to shut-down the spindle, 
-- but keep the steppers active to work on machine internals like jogging an indicator

-- Build some way of getting program to prevent starting if
--- Spindle Air Pressure isn't good
--- Steppers are in E-Stop (E-Stop the whole machine then)
--- Spindle is in E-Stop
